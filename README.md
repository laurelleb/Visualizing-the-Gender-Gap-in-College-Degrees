# Visualizing-the-Gender-Gap-in-College-Degrees

The US Department of Education releases statistics annually on the percentage of bachelor's degreees granted to women. This dataset covers the degrees granted between the years 1970 to 2012. There are 17 categories of degrees. The Department of Education started to collect this data as a way to understand the gender gap. In this case, the gender gap refers to the difference between women and men in educational attainment. 


Findings and Inferences:

STEM
Overall, the number of women receiving bachelor's degrees has increased since 1970. Nevertheless, some categories persist to have a gender gap. For instance, STEM degrees such as computer science and engineering have a wide gap between men and women with men taking the majority of those degrees. On the other hand, women are the majority in Psychology and Biology, degrees that were once majorly obtained by men. For some other STEM degrees, the gap between men and women is decreasing. 

Liberal Arts
There is a small gap for some liberal arts degrees. Communication and journalism were once degrees mainly granted to men, but that changed in the 1980s when the trend reversed. However, other liberal arts degrees such as social sciences and history do not have a gap. Sometime in the last 1990s the percentage of men and women receiving this degrees equalized. 

Other Categories
A high percentage of women receive degrees in health professions, public administration, and education. Men, on the other hand, are the majority in agriculture, business, architecture. The gap between men and women in this category has been slowly decreasing since the 1980s. 

Based on these findings, social policies and norms as well as economic realities in the 1980s had an affect on women's education choices. For further analysis, it would be interesting to see if certain policies or laws correlate with increases in women earning degrees where men are in the majority.
